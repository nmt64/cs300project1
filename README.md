## CS300 Project 1
### Tam Nguyen and Anh Dam


This program built a 3D House by OpenGL. The program allows users to select and rotate the house by mouse
in 180 degrees. The house has four views of a simple building. They are the front of the building, the left and right side of
a building, the top of the building and the back of the building. The house is colored in a pastel palette and decorated with a green grass field and some shooting stars. 


The program includes: 

- A keyboard callback function that allows the user to type "q" to exit the application.

- A reshape callback function discussed in class to handle window events.

- Two mouse callback function to handle object's rotation.
